Goals
1) Complete Flappy Beaver game (Nolan)
   - Game is complete, works, is user-friendly.
2) Complete Crossy Beaver game (Ryan)
   - Although Ryan's game is not complete, it is more complicated, with cars, lilipads, and a more intricate system for progressing through the game
   - Ryan has made a lot of progress and probably would have finished already if he had a simpler game.
3) Complete 2048 game (Noah)
   - Incomplete, gridlines are there.
   - The setting for Noah's game is there and works with the gameplayer model, he just needs to learn more javascript in order to create the actual gameplay.
4) Complete Snake game (Aiden, Nolan)
   - Game is complete, works, is user-friendly.
   - Has easter eggs.
(These games are actually coded by ourselves, not ripped from the internet)

Week of 2/1: 

Ticket #1
Noah/Aiden: Incorporate a system where users can enter their score on one of our four mini games. We will be able to store this information and users will be able to see other entered information. Add more REST API sections in website. The website will include a random word api which outputs a random word giving its definition and pronunciation. There is also a random joke api which outputs a random joke when clicked.

Ticket #2:

Ryan: Ajax - a process which allows user information and new scores to be updated without the user ever having to reload the page. This will improve website efficiency, user interface, and overall run time. AJAX uses XMLHTTPRequest object to exchange information between a server, and then uses javascript to reupload and display this information.
Nolan: Login systems

Ticket #3
Nolan: Easter Egg- Creating a separate web server and domain to run the easter egg website and creating the user interface for this server as well as a way to get back to the main site.
Easter Egg Location: http://beavers.pii.at
