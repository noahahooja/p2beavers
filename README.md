Goals
1) Complete Flappy Beaver game (Nolan)
   - Game is complete, works, is user-friendly.
2) Complete Crossy Beaver game (Ryan)
   - Although Ryan's game is not complete, it is more complicated, with cars, lilipads, and a more intricate system for progressing through the game
   - Ryan has made a lot of progress and probably would have finished already if he had a simpler game.
3) Complete 2048 game (Noah)
   - Incomplete, gridlines are there.
   - The setting for Noah's game is there and works with the gameplayer model, he just needs to learn more javascript in order to create the actual gameplay.
4) Complete Snake game (Aiden, Nolan)
   - Game is complete, works, is user-friendly.
   - Has easter eggs.
(These games are actually coded by ourselves, not ripped from the internet)
